#A brief history of kerosene

Since the early 1920s kerosene (paraffin or refined oil) and kerosene lanterns have been important features of everyday life in PNG, and  significant objects of trade and desire. 
 
Across PNG, the availability and widespread adoption of kerosene lighting during the second half of the 20th century transformed what people percieved to be an acceptable, normal, desirable or even necessary level of light at night. 

Kerosene made it possible for many rural homes to have a 'light of their own', even if they could not always afford the fuel to run it.

In the Begasin Hills, for example, kerosene made it possible for people to sit and gather indoors at night without fire. Here kerosene lanterns have long been used indoors, hung from a roof beam or placed on the floor to illuminate cooking areas and sleeping spaces. The burning fuel gives off a soft yellow light, and the glass lantern throws this light in a pool or circle, creating an illuminated radius within which people gather. 

Kerosene lanterns with an adjustable wick allowed people to keep a tiny flame alight all night long, in ways that shifted the perimeter of domestic space at night. 

Even houses that no longer burn kerosene at night carry some residue of its domestic use. The smell of burning fuel has permeated walls and roofs made of wood, bamboo and woven marota leaves, or the kerosene has left behind telltale blackened marks on walls and ceilings.


#An obsolete technology

By the 2010s, however, the place of these once ubiquitous kerosene lanterns was changing. 

Travelling across Madang - from the hill station of Simbai, at the edge of the Papua New Guinea highlands, to the banks of the Middle Ramu in the swampy coastal plains, to the hills of Begasin on field trips in 2009, 2011 and 2013 - I found kerosene lanterns hanging on the wall of homes, unused, rusting and falling into disrepair. 

Between 2011 and 2013 the price of kerosene in rural bush markets had risen by around forty per cent, from K3.50 for 500mls to K5 for 500mls. The rising costs of imported oil products and of transporting store bought goods into the corners of the province had made kerosene increasingly expensive for cash poor villagers and transformed what had once been an everyday lighting technology into an increasingly obsolete one. In Waikaisor village, emptyplastic containers once used to carry kerosene now sat unused on a shelf.

In Madang town, trade store owners reported selling no more than two kerosene lanterns a month. Their customers were more likely to buy the lamps for heat rather than light, with local chicken farmers using them to incubate newly hatched chicks.
