In Madang town, PNG's third largest urban centre, a small community of Singaporean businessmen and Chinese Malay store managers run four supermarket chains that sell everything from rice to garments. 

In the mid 2000s they began to import a new generation of battery powered torches and lanterns from their suppliers in Singapore, buying small quantities at first to test on the PNG market. These devices used newly available white LEDs, rather than glass bulbs, and produced a light that was brighter and lasted longer than any people had seen before. 

Over the next five years these stores 
witnessed an explosion in demand for battery powered LED torches. 

Today, traders import a range of shapes and sizes, including models that are designed for the nostalgic consumer to mimic the look and feel of old kerosene lanterns.

The first battery powered LED lanterns - or solar lights - appeared in Waikaisor in 2008. A group of travelling village traders from the Papua New Guinea Highlands carried a consignment of battery powered LED torches from a wholesaler in Madang into the Begasin Hills and set up a stall at the weekly market in the village of Anminik. As people remember it, these traders did not try to sell their wares, they did not have a sales pitch or marketing patter, but they did let people look at the lanterns, handle them and turn them on. 

Arasaum's second son, Peter, was so taken with them that he decided to buy one, walking home and back to collect K40 (Â£10) to make the purchase, closely followed by his brothers Tukus and Dod. Over the next five years almost every household in the hamlet acquired at least one and some people, like Arasaum and his sons Benok and Peter, acquired two.

In August 2013 Butut had three battery powered bulb torches and two battery powered LED lanterns and a soldering iron, stored in his house in Waikaisor. He bought one of the bulb torches years ago at the Poren Supermarket in Madang. Butut and wife Betty bought the second bulb torch and the two battery powered LED lanterns in a Papindo Supermarket during a visit to relatives in PNG's second largest town, Lae, sometime in 2011. Butut acquired the third from a local boy in the village of Surno, who wanted to throw it away because the bulb was broken. 'I said let me try it first and if I can fix it I will use it,' Butut explains.
