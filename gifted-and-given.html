People get hold of batteries through a variety of means. The movement and circulation of batteries into Waikasor, as people struggle to meet their needs involves a range of transactions and exchanges. 

People buy batteries by selling garden crops in local markets or by selling town bought trade store goods from the door of their homes. 

Batteries can be bought and sold but they can also be gifted and given. In the Begasin Hills people also acquire batteries through non-market and gift exchanges.

Tukus' nephew, Iswow, once bruised his feet on a stone as he walked along the river past the hamlet, and stopped to ask Tukus if he had a spare pair of Thongs. In the months after the incident Tukus went to him on at least three occasions to ask for batteries. Tukus doesn't anticipate that Iswow will now expect batteries in return. But he does anticipate that, at some point in the unspecified future, he will be called upon to reciprocate in some other way. 

Some people choose to keep hold of their used batteries so they can be given away. When the light in his lamps gets weak Butut, for example, takes the dying batteries out and stores them. He doesn't keep the batteries in the house because he has heard that they can make you sick, so he buries them in the ground, partially persuaded by the bush myth that the heat from the earth will recharge them, and keeps them until someone else needs them. This store of used batteries become objects of everyday assistance, petty gift exchanges with his brothers. When someone urgently needs a battery - like his youngest brother Dapis - they can come and ask and Butut will give him one from his pile.

Batteries have currency as gifts, in exchanges that involve expressions of reciprocity, or between brothers as expressions of everyday mutuality.

'You can always go and ask your brothers for old batteries, Daphis explained last year. 'Not too much, though. You can't go on asking, asking, asking.’ Over the past year Daphis had bought batteries from two household stores in the village, and from the one his cousin runs in an neighbouring hamlet. He has also bought them at the riverside market, and twice from store on the highway where they walk to the village. Over the same period, de had also gone and asked seven of his brothers for old batteries. 'They know that I didn’t have anything to put inside my torch. So, they give me something.' His older brothers avoid asking each other for batteries, because they know only too well how much his brothers need them. Tukus says that he prefers to ask other people, outside the hamlet for batteries.
