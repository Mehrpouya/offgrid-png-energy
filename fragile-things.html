#Fragile goods

In the humid tropics micro-electronic goods that have been mass manufactured in mainland China don't last long. In Begasin battery powered LED torches are fragile technologies. The soldering comes away and wires work themselves free of assembly boards. Bulbs and switches fall out of their fittings. Plastic casings crack or break. Battery acid leaks and corrodes the internal circuitry. 

Repaired lights often combine components collected from multiple sources. People collect wires and spare piece of metal and plastic from an array of old or broken electronic devices - including radios and torches - and their recycled or up-cycled technologies contain parts from multiple sources. 'Whoever has a radio that is broken they give them to me and I mend it and use it,' Butut explains. The resulting objects - assembled from various exchange relationships - are artefacts of knowledge, that materialise people’s knowledge of their own capacities to elicit goods through exchange.

In Waikaisor - where these lights represent a major household investment - this fragility makes them objects of considerable care and attention, shaping the attitudes and relationships of its users. 

These lamps are big things, _'bikpela samting',_ Tukus tells us. He either keeps it in safe inside his house or, when it is in use, hanging high on a wooden post. 

Tukus is very protective of his lamp and the only other person he allows to use it is his wife, Joyce. His brothers have often asked to use it but he doesn't let them. Joyce uses it inside the house at night when she is breastfeeding or to look after their children if they wake up. Their children aren't allowed to touch, hold, pick up or use the light because Tukus doesn't trust them not to drop it. 

Indeed Tukus is so concerned that the lamp might get broken that he doesn't even carry it around himself after dark. He's never taken it into the forest to use for walking around at night and he doesn't have any intention of doing so. Instead, if he needs to move around the bush at night – like on the day that we went to collect a pig from a nearby hamlet - he navigates using the moon. The only time the light moves away from his house at night is for sit down meetings or functions that take inside the hamlet, like on the night that we arrived. 

#Repaired & remade

Over the past four years since he bought it Tukus regularly takes his light apart to clean the battery compartment and the switch with a rag and a little oil. When he sees that the wires connecting the basic LED circuit board to the battery become rusty he takes these out and cleans them too. 

Not everyone, however, takes as much care of their lights. Tukus and his brother Butut have gained considerable expertise repairing, fixing and maintaining old or broken lamps. They do not expect payment for their services but frequently receive gifts in return. On one occasion, Butut fixed an LED lantern for Mary, the wife of his older brother Benok, when Benok was away. Butut took the lantern apart, found the wire had broken and soldered it back onto the ciruit board. In return Mary gave him some food. Once, for example, Butut's brother in law, James, from his wife's village of Sai, brought him an old LED lamp and asked if he could fix it. The wiring had completely come away from the circuitry, - the man and bought him three batteries to thank him, or as Butut puts it in Tok Pisin, to keep him happy, _'em I laik hamamasim mi'._
