When Papua New Guinea (PNG) became independent from Australia in September 1975 its political leaders dreamed of electrifying the nation. 

With support from international aid agencies and the World Bank PNG built large scale hydro-electric power plants and lay the groundwork for a new energy infrastructure. Between 1976 and 1992 the World Bank alone invested $US62.5 million in Papua New Guinea’s energy sector.

But in the early 1990s these dreams were put on hold. Neoliberal economic policies sought to cut public spending and reduce the national deficit. In the World Bank's assessment the cost of developing and delivering energy to consumers in rural Papua New Guinea had become 'too high'. Future attempts to deliver electricity to rural Papua New Guineans, the World Bank advised, would have to be ‘economically justified’ or reduce costs 'through lower standards'.

Today, despite being home to some of the world’s richest mineral, oil and natural gas deposits, Papua New Guinea has the lowest levels of access to grid electricity in the Asia-Pacific region. Surveys and census data suggests somewhere between 85 to 90 per cent of Papua New Guinea’s 6.5 million people live without access to electricity. For the majority of contemporary Papua New Guineans this means that life off the grid describes a historic condition, a condition of present normality and a future predicament. 


#Madang

In Madang, on PNG's north coast, the legacy of government investments in energy is strikingly apparent. 

The regional capital, Madang, is supplied with electricity by the Yonki dam and hydroelectric power plant 120 kilometers away. A line of cables and pylons traverse the province carrying electricity from the dam to the town. Places in between, like the Begasin Hills, have never been connected to the grid. 

![As Dusk Falls](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90728/Odyssey%20Energy/Map%20Packages/Package%203%20Edge%20of%20Sattelite%20View/_IMG_9757_.jpg)

As towns like Madang are been flooded with electric light they have produced the countryside in material and symbolic ways as spaces of shadow or darkness. Despite (or because of its relative proximity to an urban energy infrastructure the Begasin Hills have become an ‘out of the way place’, a place defined by its lack of and distance from electricity; a place that appears geographically far off and remote, and 'behind' the country’s urban centres. 



#Wakaisor

The Girawa speaking hamlet of Wakaisor, in the heart of the Begasin Hills, lies 45 miles south-west of Madang town. But travelling backwards and forwards can take between 6 and 9 hours, depending on how quickly you can catch a bus or pickup to take you an hour along the highway to the truck stop at Negri, how quickly you can walk along the overgrown mission road across the hills, before cutting down into valley of the Wiapan river, and follow the water to the hamlet's edge. 

![As Dusk Falls](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90728/Odyssey%20Energy/Photos/Beetlenut%20Trees.jpg)

The hamlet was founded in the 1950s by its now aging patriarch Arasaum (Asum) and the community that lives here today is composed of some 70 people, including his sons by two wives, a number of adopted sons, along with all their wives and children. These households make small amounts of cash by selling their garden produce - buai or beetlenut, taro, yam and bananas - at a nearby weekly market, through infrequent local sales of pigs and chicken, or by growing small quantities of cash crops, including rice, cocoa, and vanilla which they sell at the market in Madang town; Arasaum’s youngest sons also surreptitiously grow and sell marijuana.

The average annual income of Waikaisor’s households is around K800 (£250). Like the majority of Papua New Guinea's villages Waikaisor has never been electrified and the people who live their rely upon forestry products from their subsistence gardens to meet their energy needs for cooking. They cook food on small fires lit with timber and grasses from their gardens and combine indigenous and imported technologies for lighting.
