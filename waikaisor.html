One January we made a return trip to Waikaisor. A pig had been killed to mark our arrival and as we waited for the meat to be equally distributed, the sun went down. 

In the gathering dusk new sources of light emerged. I joined the men and boys on one side of the gathering, sitting on tree trunks around an open fire. Occasionally someone pushed a log further into the fire to keep it alight, placed a kettle of water atop a ring of stones to boil, or adding a root vegetable to roast in the hot coals. A burning log was passed around for us to light brus cigarettes, tobacco leaves rolled up in a strip of thick newspaper.

While we waited for the food Benok, the eldest son of the hamlet's founder, sat cross legged on a square of cloth hunched over a pump action, kerosene fuel Coleman’s lamp that he was attempting to fix. He dismantled the kerosene lamp, unscrewing the glass, removing the wick, and removing several inner pieces from the pump action mechanism and meticulously cleaning them, part by part. At his right hand side, three young nephews crouched down, watching intently and holding spare parts or tools whenever he asked. 

Later, a petrol generator was started up and used to power a strip light hung from one of the stilts on which the house was built. As the food was served four battery powered LED lanterns were produced to illuminate proceedings, one of them placed carefully on a workbench, and the other’s held aloft. The feast illuminated, we ate. 

Beyond our gathering, the hamlet and the forest remained in shadow.

On most nights the people of Waikaisor spend their time conserving and saving the kerosene, batteries and diesel that had illuminated our feast. 

Most nights, as dusk falls, the hamlet's villagers can be found gathered on wooden benches at the bottom of a well trodden forest path, leading from a cluster of houses up a hillside towards the house where unmarried men sleep, and beyond that the gardens. 

On nights with a clear sky and a moon, people bask in the moonlight but when the sky is blotted out by storm clouds people sit here in darkness and shadow, straining to make out figures and faces through the pitch. 


#The old ways

Everyday experiences of energy here are not defined by access or not to grid based electricity. Rather people experience energy in ways that are shaped by local histories of technology, relationships to other places and people, aspirations and desires, as well as issues of affordability and reliability. When people have kerosene they might decide to light a lantern, if people have batteries they might switch on a torch. When they have neither fuel or batteries they remain in the dark.

When the time comes to return to their homes or when they need to navigate up and down the hillside in the dark people sometimes made use of 'the old ways' rather than use imported technologies.

Flaming torches can be fashioned from dead coconut fronds, _ainen mokup_, or sticks of bamboo, _ep amup_, and held them aloft. 

Other kinds of flamable materials can be gathered or grown in the forest here but are less widely used today. The tall galib tree, for example, can be tapped for a resin that can be burned for light.

Meanwhile, the flowering candlenut bush, first introduced to the area by Luthern missionaries in the 1940s, whose influence I explore further below, produces a soft waxy seed that can be threaded onto a stalk of grass and lit.

#Fire and smoke

Later into the evening people can be found in small groups outside their homes, on an open porch or around the glowing embers of a cooking fire. 

The red glow of the cooking fire is sufficient to light people in the immediate vicinity and the smoke does a little to repel the mosquitos that breed on the damp floor of the forest or in the stagnant water on the edge of the village fish pond. But fire and smoke have other uses. People keep fires burning late into the night for security, to keep them safe from known and unknown human enemies or from malevolent bush spirits, _eitek_, that live in the forest, associated with particular glades, trees and water bodies. Smoke is a medium for communicating with these bush spirits and when you _gat wari_ or need to have a _tok save_ with the spirits, you make smoke to summon the eiteik into conversation.
