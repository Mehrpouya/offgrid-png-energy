Today vital drugs and medical equipment only reach Begasin Health Centre if they are carried. Jakob, now the only health worker at the station, goes to town and collects the medicines from the Provincial Health Office transit store.

He uses the user fees from the health centre to pay for a PMV to carry the medicines to the roadside – a small market stall on the side of the highway above a community school.

Just behind the market stall at the head of the track inland lives Samuel, whose father is from Begasin, but who settled on his mother’s land near the highway in order to be able to establish a road building business. Samuel lets Jakob store the medicine on his porch while he returns to the health centre and calls out for volunteers to come and pick the medicine up. Each village takes a turn to go and do the collection.

On arrival at the highway, the women empty the large boxes out into their string bags, which they carry on their heads. Young men carry smaller boxes on their shoulders. One person’s load can be up to 40kgs and women’s loads are generally heavier than those of men. Carrying the medicines is painful work, but people are not paid for it. Instead, I am told, it is “community work”. 

Nonetheless there is growing ambiguity over what “community work” might be. People still have to pay user fees at the health centre when they are given medicines. Sometimes, carriers told us, Jakob gives them paracetamol or amoxycillan as payment for carrying the medicines. Sometimes, if he sees them carrying the medicines, he doesn’t charge them when they come to the health centre. If there is conflict with the health centre staff, such as when Um and Gala were forced to leave in 2009, the community’s first response is to refuse to carry medicines. Similarly, if the health centre staff feel under threat, they simply close their doors; a sign that the exchange relationship has broken down.

Things have become even more complicated with efforts by international organisations such as the Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade to strengthen health systems by paying to make sure vital medicines reach remote areas. When the health workers carry out immunisation patrols, to ensure every child in the area has received basic vaccinations, they are paid extra money to go on patrol. There are also extra funds to pay carriers to carry the cool box full of vaccines. Carriers usually receive 20Kina a day. While carrying medicines is a job that rotates between villages, health workers usually give the carrier work to a limited number of young men they have built up strong exchange relationships with. These might be young men who give them buai, who they play football with, or who the health workers buy marijuana from.

Because volunteers are seen to be an unreliable way of getting medicines to remote areas, international organisations like AusAID are beginning to subcontract courier work to private companies. Health centre kits, comprised of basic equipment such as saline solution sachets and drugs, are now distributed across the country through private courier companies. In Madang, a local company won the contract, and sub-contracted the courier job for Begasin to a youth community group near the Negri highway stop. People in Begasin were confused to see young people from outside their vicinity carrying the medicines and concerned to discover that they were being paid for a job they were expected to do for free.

People accept that strangers need to be paid; it is because they benefit from the health centre that they should carry its medicines for free. But how long people will continue to carry everyday drugs and equipment for free when other ‘special’ drugs and equipment are carried for fees, remains to be seen. As a provincial health manager commented wryly: 

‘Community ends at people’s front door now.’
